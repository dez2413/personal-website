        <h3>Anime</h3>

        <p>
            Anime has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. 
            The first anime I watched was Fairy Tail, followed by many others. 
            Some of the biggest series I’ve watched include Demon Slayer, Naruto, 
            Bleach, and My Hero Academia.

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>
            When I was younger, I played a lot of hand-me-down consoles, mainly the 
            PlayStation 2. Some of my favorite games were Jak and Daxter, Spyro, 
            Crash Bandicoot, Ratchet & Clank, and various racing games. Later, 
            I got into Pokémon games like Soul Silver, Black, and Black 2. Currently, 
            I play on a PC, and one of my main games is Marvel Rivals.
