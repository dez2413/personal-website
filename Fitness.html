        <h2>My Fitness & Sport</h2>
        <div class="art">
        <p>
            My love for fitness began in high school. I was involved in basketball 
            and was also part of the color guard for five years.
        </p>
        <h3>Color Guard</h3>
        <p>
            I started color guard at Centennial High School for two years before transferring 
            to OÃ±ate High School for the remaining two years. I continued color guard in my 
            sophomore year of college as well. During this time, I developed skills in dance, 
            balance, and movement. I also helped a friend start a small program to teach elementary 
            school kids color guard, which was a unique and unexpected experience for me.
        </p>

        <h3>Basketball & Tennis</h3>
        <div class="art">
        <p>
            I played basketball for two years but eventually quit for various reasons. However, 
            I enjoyed the friendships I made and learned a lot about teamwork and dedication. 
            Later, I picked up tennis, which helped improve my agility and reaction time. 
            Unlike basketball, tennis taught me the importance of self-improvement, as it was more 
            of an individual sport.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            Over time, I shifted my focus toward strength training, agility, and maintaining my 
            overall health. Fitness has remained a consistent part of my life, and I continue to 
            challenge myself to improve.
