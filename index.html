                <p>
                Hello, my name is Desiree. Here are a few things about me: I’m currently a senior majoring in both Computer Science and Criminal Justice.
                Next semester, I will be graduating from college and looking for job opportunities in the workforce. Right now, I’m trying to expand my 
                knowledge of web development for fun and practice. As a Computer Science major, I sometimes feel that my skills are a bit lacking because
                I rushed through this degree. Originally, I planned to pursue Chemistry and Forensics. I spent about a year and a half conducting research,
                only to realize that I disliked it. However, I had some interest in Computer Science, so I decided to give it a try during the spring semester of my 
                sophomore year. I ended up really enjoying it, so I chose to pursue a degree in the field while I had the opportunity. I will be graduating in the Fall of 2025, 
                and my goal is to enter the field of cyber forensics. Hopefully, I can build a career in that area and continue developing my skills.
