                Card games have become one of my biggest hobbies. It all started when a friend 
                introduced me to her brother’s card shop. I initially went to play board games 
                but gradually got more involved with the card games played there. Over time, I 
                learned about Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, Beyblade, and One Piece card games.

            </div>
            <p>
                About a year ago, I decided to compete in Magic: The Gathering regional qualifiers. 
                I reached third place, but I wasn’t aiming to win since I couldn’t afford to travel 
                across the country for the next level of competition. Still, I enjoyed the experience, 
                especially getting to travel with friends and the community I had built around the game.
