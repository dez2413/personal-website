            <h2>Art & Drawing</h2>
            <h3> Beginning of learning of Art</h3>
            <div class="art">
            <p>
                I have a lot of hobbies and tend to dabble in many different things. One of the hobbies I started 
                was Art. I started drawing in elementary and middle school, creating random sketches. As I improved, 
                I continued drawing into high school and early college, but eventually, I slowed down and almost 
                stopped entirely. Though I still practice occasionally, it’s not as frequent as before. Looking back,
                I can see how much my skills have developed.

            <h3>Art Experiment & Learning Techniques</h3>
            <div class="art">
            <p>
                In the beginning, I used basic pencil outlines before switching to pen for cleaner linework. 
                I colored my drawings with standard colored pencils, but I didn’t understand shading or blending.
                 As I progressed, I started incorporating more depth into my art, practicing shading and blending 
                 techniques with my favorite anime characters. Eventually, I explored charcoal and a bit of painting.
                  However, I lost motivation and took a break from art until I decided to dabble in it again in college.

            <div class="art">
            <p>
                During the time I wasn’t drawing, I got into hiking and photography. I enjoyed capturing landscapes 
                and occasionally took pictures of people during interesting events. I started editing my photos, 
                which led me to experiment with graphic design and crocheting in college, though I haven’t pursued it seriously.

                This is some of the digit art that I did during college. I did some picture of peole and I started to make
                 and seel crotchet animals for fun. I had a lot of free in the beginning of college because of covid. So 
                 during my free time I started to created and seel crocheting item that people like. This was a way I made 
                 a side business this time and sell some of the stuff animal that I wanted to created that I didn't have room 
                 to place them.
